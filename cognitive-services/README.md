# Face Detection & Recognition 

* Android sample uses Google's Mobile Vision APIs for face detection and Microsoft Cognitive Services for Recognition.
* iOS samples use CIDetector and CIFeature for Face Detection and Microsoft Cognitive Services for Recognitio

Microsoft Cognitive Services Client APIs and Helpers were reused from this [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk)

> Note: The demo samples use Face Registration in the load method of the app. Do not use that in your production. The best place to use them is in the user registration page.
